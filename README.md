# zhongwen-safari
Zhongwen browser extension for safari (converted with apple's extension converter)
All I did was convert with xcode and change the app icons to look nicer in safari, thought I'd upload so other people don't have to go through the hassle, and since frill and popover chinese are deprecated now
